## Solaris

This project represents a collaboration between two of my friends with sound engineering backgrounds (Street Sorcery and Samuel Cartier) and I to create an audio-visual science-fiction themed clip.

The project is written in **React with Typescript** and uses the react-h5-audio-player and react-sound packages to display the audio player and sync the two tracks properly. The graphics are svg-based and are colored and animated using CSS (formatted from SASS). Other animations and transitions are controlled with React inline styling and states.

The monologue was recorded and edited by Street Sorcery.
The background music was composed by Samuel Cartier.
